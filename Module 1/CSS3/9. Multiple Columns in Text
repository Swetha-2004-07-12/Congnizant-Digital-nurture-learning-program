    <h2>Community Bulletin</h2>
    <p>
      This weekend, the annual Spring Festival will be held at the town center. Residents are invited to join the celebrations, which include live music, a farmer’s market, food trucks, and kids’ games. Local artists will also showcase their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Volunteers are still needed for setup, cleanup, and guiding guests. You can sign up at the community office or via the event portal. All participants will receive a free T-shirt and lunch vouchers. We look forward to seeing everyone there!
